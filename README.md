# MazeSolverGUI

## Note: This project requires JavaFX libraries. These dependencies are not set up via Git. I have uploaded this project in order to build my portfolio. Dependencies will need manually setting up, but I intend to automate this in the future.

This project, based on the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI), takes an image of a maze, processes the image by converting it into a graph, then solves the graph for the shortest path. This solution is then 'drawn' onto the original image in order to present the solved path.
